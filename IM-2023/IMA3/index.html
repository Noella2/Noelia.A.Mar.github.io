            <p>
                For my website, I chose the prompts of interwoven and feedback to guide my interaction design. My
                interpretation of interwoven was in how one thing affects another, and how these connections impact the
                final result of an interaction. I also wanted to incorporate feedback as a visualiser of these
                connections between interactions, whilst also creating a visual end goal. With this in mind, I designed
                a grid of buttons in which when one button is clicked, the other buttons change to a different colour to
                visualise how the buttons are interwoven and affect each other. Additionally, because the buttons
                alternate between two values, by the end, a pattern will be seen through the button which was achieved
                by clicking the buttons in a certain order. This visually represents how each interaction has led to the
                final pattern. I styled the website using orange, yellow and purple complementary colours, alongside a
                soft border and animation. I decided to use this styling as through my previous assessments, I used a
                similar colour palette and wanted to unify and replicate this in my final interaction.

                Challenges I encountered whilst making the page was getting the colour change and animation to apply to
                all buttons except the one which is clicked. At first, I thought of using a filter to search for clicked
                and unclicked buttons, however, this proved difficult and I ended up creating this using a toggle. The
                toggle worked by taking the value of the button clicked as “e” and stating that the function be applied
                to everything within the button array that did not equal to “e”, the button clicked. Then I used a basic
                if-else statement for the alternating colours. Additionally, I had to change my hover and active
                feedback for the button from background colour to border and shadow box styling as the background colour
                styling on hover and active was overridden by the background colour alternating in javascript.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, I think I created an interaction which successfully demonstrates the ideas of interwoven and
                feedback, and how they can work together. I really like how as the buttons are clicked a pattern reveals
                how all the buttons are interconnected, which as a result creates a pattern which visualises this and
                can be unique depending on the order in which the user clicks the buttons. Additionally, I feel the
                animation of a flip helps visualise this further. However, I feel that having all the buttons flip
                together makes the page feel cluttered and confusing. Perhaps a more subtle animation could be used to
                declutter the page whilst still giving enough feedback to users. I had also planned to include more than
                two colours for the buttons to switch to but ultimately feel that two colours are better. This is
                because it was more simple. clearer and more colours would have been confusing with a flip animation
                which suggests two sides to a button thus two colours.

        Creating the individual buttons to arrange along the grid styling in a 5 by 5 ratio. I chose to go 5 by 5 as it was enough squares to get
        my point of buttons interactivity across, but not too many that the experience was confusing and difficult to undertake. I set the style 
        to orange so my javascript function was able to read the colour variable and toggle the right if else statement
