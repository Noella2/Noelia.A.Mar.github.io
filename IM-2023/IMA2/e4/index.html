 <!-- I arranged the elements in order from play, mute, video timeline and fullscreen. The beginning features buttons which are most likely to 
  be used most, thus on the left where the viewer’s eyes scan to first. I also placed the fullscreen button on the other end as this is a
   less-used function. Additionally, this is how most streaming platforms such as YouTube and Vimeo lay these elements out, thus fitting into
    users’ experiences as to where things will be.-->

       <!-- I decided to include full screen as my additional feature to the video player. I felt this would give the most value to users as it
         allows them to control how they view it and being a video, the quality and size one views it is of much importance. Additionally,
          unlike platforms such as YouTube, this website has no other videos elements so a backward or skip button makes no sense as there 
          are no other videos to skip to. -->
