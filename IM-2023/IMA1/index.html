</h2>

<br>
<br>

    <lu>
            <lo>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
                <p>The first thing I did was scan the page and clicked the hyperlinks which were blue in colour and drew my eyes to them.</p>
            </lo>

                    <br>

            <lo>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.

                    Throughout my experience i interacted and engaged by:
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                        - Closing components
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        -  Reading text
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        - Scrolling
                    <br>
                    </p>
                    </lu>
                </lo>      

                 <br>

            <lo>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
                <p>The features I engaged with the most was clicking the buttons. They were very engaging for me as I was waiting for something to occur when I clicked them in a certain order. However this never occurred, peaking my engagement more in exploring different combinations to click and see if there was something hiding. </p>
            </lo>

        <br>

            <lo>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?
                <p> The most common action I did when using the website was moving my mouse around to explore the page by clicking buttons, boxes, and moving the slider around. </p>
            </lo>

        <br>

            <lo>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
                <p> My interactions gave me the impression the website's goal is to engage users' curiosity and playfulness. I found this to be the case as it challenged my expectations and was arranged in a unique manner compared to commercial websites which have aligned and arranged componentes.
                </p>
            </lo>
        <br>
            <lo>6. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?
                <p>The website communicated their goal in a universal manner using familiar concepts such as buttons to use, which I found challenged my expectation in that there was no response from the website for interacting. This perked my interest as it challenged my expectation and led me to play around with the buttons more to see if I could find a response.
                </p>
            </lo>
        <br>
            <lo> 7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
                <p> The website feels like it is intended to be used for short sessions. I went back multiple times to try different combinations of buttons and boxes to see if they would do anything new. Additionally there is minimal text on the website which gave me an overall summary of his portfolio in a quick and easy manner to digest. This allowed me to spend more time on certain aspects via the use of hyperlink leading to his other pages. I felt it was a good portfolio page to be visited often for short periods of time.
                </p>
            </lo>
        <br>
      
            <lo>8. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?
                <p>The interactive components communicate the use of short sessions by being scattered around the page. I would jump around the page interacting with the slider, the buttons and the boxes interchangeably. However, once I finished with each component, it allowed me to close them and move on to other components of the website. Additionally their muted grey colours create a lack of focus on any one particular interactive component, which leaded me to jump around and start with different things randomly each time I revisit the website. Additionally the repeating GIF in the centre, which I would watch on loop eventually bored me after a while, further amplifying the website to be used in short sessions.

<h2>Week 3 Questions</h2>
<br>
    
    <br>
        <lu>
            <lo>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?
                <p>As I was using the website, I felt like the website was laid out like sticky notes. The square appearance of each component arranged around the page with an X in the corner felt similar to sticky notes arranged on a board with a pin. I clicked the X each time I was done with a componentes similar to taking a sticky note down from a to do list. Additionally, each component had a brief information summary similar to a written reminder.
                </p>
            </lo>
        <br>
            <lo>10. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?
                <p>The website felt like it should be interacted in a quick manner similar to an information board. It was very easy to read and produced the collection of information in small chunks. I particularly found the ability to close components once I was done enhanced this as I was  unable to revisit information once I had finished and closed it.
                </p>
            </lo> 
        <br>
            <lo> 11. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?
                <p>Through the experience I felt a sense of accomplishment. As I used the website to close sections I was finished using, this action gave me a sense of acknowledgment as I was done with certain components. Additionally I felt accomplished interacting with the boxes when I clicked all of them. The slider which changed the boxes into curves also left a satisfying feeling in their pleasing appearance.
                </p>
            </lo>
        <br>
            <lo>12. What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?
                <p>The most frustrating components of the website were mostly aesthetic. I disliked the arrangement of the components as they did not line up or have an orderly manner, which I usually expect from a website. Additionally, due to this some components extended past the screen and required the scroll bar to access which I also found frustrating and annoying.
                </p>
            </lo>
         
        <br>
            <lo> 13. What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?
                <p>The most satisfying interaction was the ability for me to close components once I was done. I enjoyed the ability to discard information I was done with and focus on new information. Once I was finished with all components, I was left with an empty web page which was satisfying as a result of the progressive decluttering of the website by closing components.</p>
